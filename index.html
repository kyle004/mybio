<p>My name is Kyle, Im 29 years old born and raised in Southern California.
I've been a personal trainer for about 6 years but have I've had a passion and interest in coding since I was a
teenager. Due to covid, I decided to change career paths and do something I enjoy doing as well as something that is stable.
So here I am, starting my new journey into becoming a developer!
Besides that, I'm big into working out and being active. I also enjoy reading, playing guitar, and of course, video
games!
